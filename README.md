# Ansible Learning

This repository contains my Ansible learning materials. Ansible is a powerful open-source automation tool that can be used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and more.

# Prerequisites

Before getting started with Ansible, it's important to have a few prerequisites installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. pip3
3. SSH client

# Installation

To install Ansible, you can use pip3:

```
  pip install ansible
```

# Usage

Once you have Ansible installed, you can use it to automate your tasks. Here are a few examples:

1. Inventory management: Ansible can be used to manage your inventory of servers, network devices, and more. You can define groups of hosts, assign variables to them, and more.

2. Playbook execution: Ansible playbooks are written in YAML and describe a set of tasks to be executed on one or more hosts. You can use playbooks to deploy applications, configure servers, and more.

3. Ad-hoc commands: Ansible also allows you to execute ad-hoc commands on your hosts. For example, you could use Ansible to gather information about your hosts, or to run a one-time command.
